# 💾 Hopify SQL Best Practices

This document outlines SQL query standards, formatting, and file organization best practices for the **Hopify SaaS v15** project.  
Following these standards ensures clean, reusable, and collaboration-friendly SQL queries across teams.

## 📑 File Naming Conventions

| File Type        | Naming Example                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Common Views      | `hopify_common_views.sql`                 |
| Scenario Queries  | `1-hopify_churn_analysis.sql`             |
| Ad-hoc Queries    | `adhoc_[short_description].sql`           |

- Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names.
- Prefix with numbers to control logical order (optional but recommended).

## 🧾 File Header Template

```sql
/*
Created By: [Full Name]
Created On: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Description: [Short description of file purpose]
*/
✅ Query Block Formatting
Use CTEs for modular logic
sql
Copy
Edit
WITH monthly_churn AS (
    ...
),
monthly_active AS (
    ...
)
SELECT ...
Query Labels & Aliases
Metric Example	Preferred Column Label
Churn Rate %	churn_rate_percent
Net Revenue Retention %	nrr_percent
Gross Revenue Retention %	grr_percent

✔ Use snake_case for output columns.

✔ Avoid spaces in column aliases ("Churn Rate %" ➡ churn_rate_percent).

💡 Code Readability Best Practices
SQL Keywords in UPPERCASE.

Consistent indentation (4 spaces recommended).

Always alias tables (orders o, customers c).

Always qualify column names (o.order_date instead of order_date).

🛡 Defensive SQL Practices
Use NULLIF, COALESCE for safe division.

Use LEFT JOIN carefully; double-check if you truly want unmatched rows.

Use LIMIT on exploratory queries.

Always test with EXPLAIN for performance on large tables.

🔁 Reusability & Maintainability
Extract common metric logic (e.g., churn rate, cohort sizing) into common views or CTEs.

Prefer creating Views or CTEs over duplicating queries across scenario files.

Include testing and validation blocks in each file (-- Validate: Total MRR check).

🗣 Interpretive Comments
At the end of complex queries, add interpretation comments:

sql
Copy
Edit
/*
✅ Interpretation:
SMB segment shows higher churn (~12%) compared to Enterprise (~4.5%).
Patterns align with SaaS industry benchmarks.
*/
🔄 Versioning & Change Logs (Optional)
Maintain a header change log when updating scenario files.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
/*
v1.0 - Initial queries - 2025-05-13
v1.1 - Added GRR by segment logic - 2025-05-15
*/
📊 SQL Output Recommendations
Use consistent KPI units (%, $, counts).

For business storytelling, add comments recommending visualization types (line chart, cohort matrix, heatmap).

Consider producing pivoted versions (where possible) for executive-ready reports.

💡 Quick Checklist Before Sharing
 Does the file have a clean header block?

 Are queries using safe NULLIF division logic?

 Are key metrics labeled consistently?

 Is CTE logic modular and easy to follow?

 Are interpretations or expected results commented where useful?

 Are redundant queries centralized into common files?

Would you also like me to draft a **matching Hopify-style `README.md` for your SQL Pack folder that integrates these practices?**  
If yes, just say `"Yes, SQL Pack README."`
