âœ… Interpretations:
Revenue is scaling consistently as customer base and order volume grow.

AOV remains stable (~$1,000), which aligns well given the segment and product skew adjustments in the v11/v12 dataset.

Healthy monthly growth momentum can be observed, with minor seasonality dips (e.g. July/August slowdowns, which is typical for commerce businesses).
