# 🏗️ Hopify SaaS DB Generator  
**Version:** `v1.0`  
📅 Released: May 2025

A Python-based generator that creates a realistic, benchmark-aware **B2B SaaS customer lifecycle database** for Hopify. Simulates acquisition, subscriptions, churn, and KPIs across `SMB`, `Mid-Market`, and `Enterprise` segments for SQL-based scenario analysis.

---

## 🧠 Overview
